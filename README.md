# Budget-Manager
This C++ code implements a "Budget Management System" that allows users to manage finances through account registration, login, and budget tracking. Key features include:
User Authentication: New users can register, while existing users can log in using stored credentials.
Control Panel: Options for adding income, expenses, updating budget, viewing summaries, and generating budget reports.
Budget Management: Files store user-specific data like income, expenses, and budget updates, enabling personalized financial summaries and reports.
The program uses a simple command-line interface, file handling for data storage, and labels to navigate different menu options.
